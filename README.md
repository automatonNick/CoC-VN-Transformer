# CoC-VN-Transformer
## Java swing and mySQL

This is a Visual interface for the "Alone against" series of Call of Cthulhu adventures using the java swing interface and a mysql database to store character data and story progression.

The idea behind it is that of a simple text parser that will transform the page numbers into headers and the directions into buttons to guide the player with an integrated character sheet and dice rolling area.
